# CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python 🧠

Welcome to my learning journey through [CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/) by Harvard University.

## 📚 Course Description

This course explores the foundational concepts and algorithms behind modern artificial intelligence. Topics include:
- Search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*)
- Knowledge representation and logical inference
- Optimization problems
- Probability and uncertainty
- Markov models and machine learning
- Neural networks and natural language processing

Throughout the course, we implement projects in Python that power systems like:
- Game-playing agents
- Handwriting recognition tools
- Language translation engines
- Planning and prediction systems

## 💡 Why I’m Taking This Course

I’m passionate about understanding how intelligent systems work from the ground up. This course is a chance to:
- Build hands-on projects that simulate real-world AI applications
- Learn the logic and math powering models I’ve only interacted with from the surface
- Strengthen my Python skills in the context of applied AI

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras (later modules)
- NumPy
- Git / GitHub

## 📌 Notes & Reflections

I’m documenting my key learnings, bugs I encountered, and how I debugged them in the `notes/` directory (coming soon). I hope this helps me — and maybe others — understand not just the *what* but the *why* behind these AI techniques.
